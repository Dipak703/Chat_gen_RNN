Mother Earth, unable to bear the burden of sins committed by evil kings and rulers, appealed to Brahma the creator for help. Brahma, in turn, prayed to the Supreme Lord Vishnu, who assured Brahma that Vishnu would soon return Earth to annihilate tyrannical forces.

Kamsa, the ruler of Mathura (in northern India) was one such tyrant, inspiring fear among all the rulers. On the day Kamsa's sister Devaki was married to Vasudeva, a voice from the sky prophesied that Devaki's eighth son would destroy Kamsa.

Frightened, Kamsa jailed the couple and vowed to kill any child Devaki gave birth to. He made good on his word, killing the first seven infants Devaki bore Vasudeva, and the imprisoned couple feared their eighth child would meet the same fate. 

Lord Vishnu appeared before them, telling them he would return to Earth in the guise of their son and rescue them from Kamsa's tyranny. When the divine baby was born, Vasudeva found himself magically freed from prison, and he fled with the infant to a safe house. Along the way, Vishnu removed obstacles like snakes and floods from Vasudeva's path.

Vasudeva gave the infant Krishna to a family of cowherds, exchanging him for a newborn girl. Vasudeva returned to the prison with the girl. When Kamsa learned of the birth, he rushed to the prison to kill the child. But when he arrived, the infant ascended to the heavens and was transformed into the goddess Yogamaya. She warned Kamsa that his nemesis had already been born elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Krishna was raised as a cowherd, leading an idyllic childhood. As he matured, he became a skillful musician, wooing the women of his village with his flute-playing. Eventually, he returned to Mathura, where he slew Kamsa and his henchmen, restored his father to power, and became friendly with many of Hinduism's heroes, including the warrior Arjuna.
